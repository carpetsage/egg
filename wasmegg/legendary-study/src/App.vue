        legendary study are posted here. You can view historical reports and compare reports to see
        how legendary ownership of the player base has evolved over time. Keep in mind that data
        posted here are subject to selection bias; players who use the rockets tracker and opt in to
        the study are likely more avid than the majority of the Egg, Inc. player base at large.

        What is the difference between this app and the <a

          class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600"
          >previous one</a
        > by mk2? The reports generated by the previous study were limited to 20 legendarys since people with more 
        than that were considered, at the time, certain cheaters. Now there are plenty of legit people with more then 
        20 legendarys and that's why this study. Please note that the entire backend of this app has been rebuilt 
        from scratch by Brosssh#1148 and errors may occure, contact him on Discord in case of bugs/suggestions.
