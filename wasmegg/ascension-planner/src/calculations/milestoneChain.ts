 * Reaches a specific research level milestone as fast as possible, one level at a time. At every
 * step, in order:
 *
 * 0. Compute buying the target directly right now (`calculateResearchROI` — internally sale-aware,
 *    choosing whichever's faster between today's price and a future discount — and gives us the
 *    target's own `earningsDelta`/`showSaleWarning` alongside the price/wait, so a single call
 *    covers what used to be a separate `getSaleAwareTimeToSave` call too).
 * 1-2. Try a same-cycle DETOUR (`findRoiDetour`): a cheap purchase bought FIRST whose OWN economics
 *    clear the 70%-by-next-sale bar and fully pay back (`totalRoiSeconds`, or the pair-adjusted
 *    equivalent) no later than the target's own direct-buy time from step 0. Tried unconditionally,
 *    whether or not the target is reachable this cycle: a detour can shorten a calendar-locked wait
 *    too. Any candidate clearing both bars is taken — there's no separate "does this actually get
 *    the target sooner" simulation on top, because a purchase that's already fully paid for itself
 *    by the point the target would've arrived anyway can't leave the target worse off, and every
 *    second after keeps compounding at the new, higher earn rate.
 * 3. If the target's direct purchase completes STRICTLY before the very next research sale starts,
 *    no detour helped, AND — for research that actually produces earnings — buying now would itself
 *    clear the same 70%-by-next-sale bar, buy it.
 * 4. Otherwise — the direct purchase lands at/after the next sale, or lands before it but wouldn't
 *    earn back 70% of its own cost in time (buying a couple minutes before the sale at full price,
 *    when waiting those couple minutes would have meant 70% off, is never worth it) — sweep for
 *    more purchases that clear the 70%-by-next-sale bar (`sweepUntilNextSale`, mirroring what a
 *    player manually running "Buy Until Sale Warning" would do), WITHOUT jumping straight to the
 *    sale boundary. If the sweep finds anything, take it and go back to step 0 — a denser
 *    bank/higher earnings rate may unlock a detour, or direct reachability, that didn't apply before.
 * 5. Only when NEITHER a detour NOR a sweep purchase helps does the loop finally idle-forward to the
 *    next sale boundary (`idleForwardTo`) and retry from there — repeating this for as many sale
 *    cycles as it actually takes (see `MAX_SALE_SWEEPS_SAFETY_CAP`'s own comment — there's no "give
 *    up after N cycles" heuristic here) is what lets the milestone discover "abandon waiting for any
 *    particular sale, spend a couple of weeks sweeping instead, and buy at full price before the
 *    next one even arrives" — a global strategy shift a straight one-shot `getSaleAwareTimeToSave`
 *    call could never find on its own.
 *
 * Steps 1-2 and 5 used to be reversed — sweep-then-idle-forward-to-the-boundary ran BEFORE the
 * detour check ever got a chance to run, meaning every detour candidate got evaluated as if it
 * would be bought "at the boundary" (often during a research sale, hence sale-discounted). Trying
 * the detour check at every step, before any idle-forwarding happens, fixed the common case, but a
 * subtler version of the same bug survived: `showSaleWarning`'s deadline is always "the NEXT sale,"
 * and idle-forwarding INTO a sale pushes that deadline a full cycle further out (today's ~1-hour
 * runway becomes next week's ~7-day runway) — so a purchase genuinely rejected minutes before a
 * sale can pass easily the instant the loop lands inside it, purely because the deadline itself
 * moved, not because anything about the purchase changed. Confirmed against a live execution log:
 * detours "discovered" only after such an idle-forward got bought by live execution BEFORE the sale
 * anyway (money compounds continuously; live execution never idle-forwards), at full price instead
 * of the discount the plan assumed. Step 3's own 70%-by-next-sale gate on the target purchase closes
 * the same gap for the final purchase specifically: without it, a target that's merely FASTER to buy
 * now than to wait (which is all `calculateResearchROI` alone optimizes for) would jump the gun by a
 * few minutes rather than taking the discount, exactly the "5 minutes before the sale" case the
 * detour-side fix already exists to prevent.
