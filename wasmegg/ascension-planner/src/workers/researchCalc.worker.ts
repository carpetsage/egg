/**
 * Web Worker entry point for the four heavy research-plan simulations behind the Milestones and
 * Smart Buy views (milestone chain, 70% Return, Buy Until Sale Ends, Quick Buy). Each was a plain
 * synchronous call on the main thread — fine for a `computed`/`watchEffect`'s dependency tracking,
 * but a large one (near the 2000-simulated-purchase cap `calculations/*` enforces) can block the
 * main thread long enough to trip Chrome's "Page Unresponsive" hang detector. That detector only
 * watches the main thread's ability to respond, not a Web Worker's — a worker can peg its own
 * thread for as long as it needs without the tab ever being flagged as hung, which is the entire
 * reason this file exists.
 *
 * Thin dispatcher only: every request kind maps 1:1 to one of the pure functions
 * `calculations/milestoneChain.ts`/`calculations/smartBuyPreview.ts` already had — nothing here
 * re-implements or shortcuts them. Do NOT import `engine/adapter.ts`'s Pinia-bound helpers
 * (`getSimulationContext`, the no-snapshot fallback branch of `createBaseEngineState`) here — they
 * throw immediately outside a Pinia context, which a worker never has. Building `context`/
 * `startSnapshot` stays useResearchCalcWorker.ts's callers' job, on the main thread, exactly as
 * before; this worker only ever receives them already resolved, over `postMessage`. (This same
 * split — and the fact that `engine/compute.ts`/`engine/apply.ts`/`calculations/*` are themselves
 * Pinia-free and safe to import in a worker — was previously verified for the same modules by the
 * beam search feature's worker, removed in commit `ce0be3af` but still in git history as a working
 * reference: `src/workers/beamSearch.worker.ts`.)
 *
 * Loaded via Vite's native worker support — no bundler config needed:
 *   new Worker(new URL('./researchCalc.worker.ts', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' })

// Typed as `Worker` — the DOM-lib interface describing a worker instance as seen from the *main*
// thread (postMessage/onmessage/onerror) — rather than the `webworker` lib's own
// `DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope`. Deliberate, same workaround the (now-removed) beam search worker
// used: tsconfig.json's `lib` array is `["esnext", "dom"]`, shared by the whole program (no
// per-file/per-folder tsconfig here), and TypeScript's `dom` and `webworker` libs declare
// conflicting globals (`self`, `postMessage`, ...) when both are in scope. `Worker`'s shape is close
// enough for everything this file needs, without touching the shared tsconfig or adding a second
// one just for this file.
