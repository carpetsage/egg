// Precomputed, flat, sorted table of every occurrence of a given (weekday, hour) in Pacific Time,
// across a fixed, generous calendar window — built once per (day, hour) key, on first use, then
// reused forever via binary search.
//
// Why a precomputed table instead of a lazy/incremental cache: the universe of relevant timestamps
// here is tiny and fully known in advance (~208/year across the 4 weekly events this app cares
// about — Monday/Tuesday/Friday/Saturday 9am Pacific). Discovering that lazily, one query at a
// time, sounds like the "efficient" choice, but this app's actual query pattern defeats it: the
// milestone-chain algorithm evaluates many candidate researches per step, each with its own (often
// wildly different, non-monotonic) wait time, so queries ping-pong between near and far points in
// time. Every incremental-cache design tried here — a single growing list, then multiple discovered
// ranges — ended up paying for repeated brute-force `Intl.DateTimeFormat` walks (up to ~200 calls
// each) because "the next query" kept landing outside whatever had been discovered so far,
// regardless of how much bookkeeping was added; measured at 45+ seconds in a real milestone
// recompute. A flat table sidesteps the problem entirely: since every point in [TABLE_START,
// TABLE_END) is precomputed, EVERY query is an O(log n) binary-search hit, no matter how much it
// jumps around in time — there is nothing left to discover, so there is nothing left to miss.
// Covers every case where a DST-exact answer actually matters. getTimeToSave never caps a
// genuinely-reachable wait down to a fake Infinity (see its own doc comment — that was tried once
// and it broke exactly this), so a candidate purchase evaluated from a very weak starting state CAN
// legitimately produce an accumulated wait of centuries — arbitrarily far beyond any table it'd be
// practical to precompute (widening this from 85 to 1000 years measurably barely moved a real
// reproduction's out-of-table query count, confirming the tail is unbounded, not just "currently a
// bit too far"). So this table doesn't try to cover that tail: `getNextPacificTime` extrapolates
// past `TABLE_END_SECONDS` using cheap weekly-periodicity arithmetic instead (see there), which
// only loses DST precision (~1hr, twice a year) — irrelevant at a distance where
// `boostTransitionsFrom` itself already documents approximating "the last known state holds" as
// acceptable. 85 years keeps the one-time build trivial (~115ms across all 4 real keys) while still
// giving an exact answer for anything remotely close to real-world planning horizons.
