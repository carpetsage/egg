 * Central home for this app's "flip to true, temporarily, for debugging" console-log switches —
 * each one gates a specific investigation's logging, off by default. Collected in one leaf module
 * (rather than one local `const` per file) so unrelated layers (`calculations/`, `auto/`,
 * `components/`) can all import the same switch without introducing a dependency in the wrong
 * direction (nothing under `calculations/` otherwise depends on `auto/`, and this file lives in
 * `lib/`, already the common lower layer both of those import from), and so a flag shared across
 * multiple files (like `DEBUG_SHIFT_TIMING`, read by both `auto/ascension.ts` and
 * `auto/shifts/c3.ts`) can't silently drift into two independent copies — confirmed in practice
 * once already: flipping only one file's own local copy left the other's calls completely
 * unlogged.
 *
 * Each flag names the investigation it was added for in its own doc comment; delete a flag (and
 * its call sites' `if` guards) once that investigation is fully resolved, rather than letting them
 * accumulate indefinitely.
