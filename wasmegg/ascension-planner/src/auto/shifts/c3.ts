/**
 * C3: the "build phase" shift, spent riding out one or more weekly research sales in Curiosity.
 *
 * 1. Shift to Curiosity.
 * 2. If Tier 13 is wanted: first, if Multiversal Layering 2 isn't already unlocked, try to grab it
 *    via the milestone view's research-level-target chain — staged as level 1 (if not already
 *    bought) then level 2, as two separate chain attempts, so a level-1-only ML doesn't get skipped
 *    just because a level-2 attempt run straight from level 0 couldn't fully land in time — then try
 *    to unlock Tier 13. Grabbing ML2 first is a soft preference, not a hard requirement — tier
 *    unlocks are purely a total-purchase-count threshold (see `isTierUnlocked`), so ML2 is never
 *    actually required to reach Tier 13,
 *    just cheap and valuable enough to be worth grabbing first *when there's room*. So if ML2 +
 *    Tier 13 together don't fit before `buildPhaseEnd`, this rewinds to right after the Curiosity
 *    shift and retries spending the *entire* remaining budget on Tier 13 alone, skipping ML2 —
 *    since the two together running out of runway doesn't mean Tier 13 alone would too. Only if
 *    that second attempt also fails to unlock Tier 13 in time is the variant declared impossible.
 *    Each of `runResearchMilestoneIfWorthwhile`/`runTierUnlockMilestone` is capped at exactly the
 *    remaining `buildPhaseEnd - getAbsTime()` at the time it's called, so any single attempt can
 *    only ever end one of two ways: it finishes within its budget (leaving `getAbsTime()` at or
 *    before `buildPhaseEnd`, never after), or it doesn't finish at all — there's no third case
 *    where it "succeeds but finishes late," so a plain post-attempt tier check is the complete
 *    impossible/possible test for each attempt; no separate overrun handling is needed here.
 * 3. Repeat: buy earnings research that clears Smart Buy's two ROI gates, then wait for the next
 *    sale to start — until reaching the start of the final sale (the one ending at the build
 *    phase's end). This naturally does fewer cycles (or none) if step 2's Tier 13 unlock already
 *    consumed enough real time to cross earlier sales while buying — the loop just walks forward
 *    from wherever `getAbsTime()` currently is via `getNextSaleStart`/`getNextSaleEnd`, it doesn't
 *    count cycles. The two gates (see `rankResearchByROI`'s `showBuyNowRoiWarning`/
 *    `showFullRoiWarning` doc comments in researchROI.ts, and SMART_BUY_DUAL_ROI_DESIGN.md §1/§2.3)
 *    are identical to the manual planner's own "70% Return" button, with no C3-specific override
 *    needed for either: the near-term gate is always judged against whichever sale is immediately
 *    upcoming (or bypassed outright while already buying at a live discount, whichever sale that
 *    happens to be), and the full-payback gate is judged against `buildPhaseEnd` — this shift's own
 *    commitment to riding out every sale between now and then, passed as `fullRoiDeadline` — so a
 *    purchase doesn't need to fully pay for itself by any one sale along the way, only by the end of
 *    the whole ride.
 * 3a. Whenever a step-3 cycle's target is the ride's FINAL sale specifically, and that cycle's own
 *    two-gated buying runs out of qualifying candidates before actually reaching that sale's start,
 *    fill whatever's left of that gap with delivery-relevant research that's economical to buy now
 *    rather than defer — see `buyFinalSaleGap`/`simulateFinalSaleGapBuy`'s own doc comments for the
 *    full "why" (short version: some of what step 4 below buys for its delivery impact also raises
 *    earnings, and step 4 never gates on ROI at all, so it's worth pulling forward into otherwise-
 *    idle time whenever doing so pays for itself before the final sale even starts). Only applies to
 *    the cycle immediately before the final sale — every earlier cycle's own idle gap has no
 *    equivalent "what does the eventual delivery buy look like" to weigh a pre-buy against.
 * 4. Buy delivery research until nothing more is worth buying (not necessarily until the sale
 *    itself ends — once purchasing stalls out, C3 stops there rather than padding the clock the
 *    rest of the way to `buildPhaseEnd`; K3, the next shift, already waits out any remaining time
 *    against that same `buildPhaseEnd`, so a second wait here would be redundant).
 *
 * Steps 3-4 both reuse the exact same plan-computation functions the manual planner's "Buy Until
 * Sale Warning"/"Buy Until Sale Ends" buttons are built on — `simulateSaleAwareBuy`/
 * `simulateSaleEndsBuy` in `calculations/smartBuyPreview.ts` — rather than a separate
 * auto-planner-only implementation; see those functions' own doc comments for what each actually
 * does. This replaces the previous design's extra "buy earnings research toward the final sale's
 * 100% deadline" bridging step between sales: `simulateSaleAwareBuy`/`simulateSaleEndsBuy` already
 * handle their own edge cases (sale-bypass purchases, earnings-prelude-before-delivery trimming),
 * so a bespoke C3-only step is no longer needed.

  // Bug (fixed 2026-08-12): this used to deduplicate `researchIdsInOrder` down to first-seen research

  // then wormhole_dampening"). Since every one of these purchases raises the earn rate, and the
  // interleaved order is what lets that rate ramp up fastest, batching by research id took
  // measurably longer in real elapsed time to execute the exact same final purchases — confirmed
  // against a live manual-planner replay of the same 28-purchase plan: same items, same end levels,
  // but ~2.5 real days slower to finish, which meant several fewer days of pure idle earnings
  // accumulation before the following sale. The manual planner's own real execution
  // (`runSaleAwareBuyFlow`/`handleBuyUntilSaleDeadline`) never had this bug — it already walks its
  // plan in real order, one entry at a time — so this was a defect specific to this replay helper.
  // `buildNote`, when given, mirrors the manual planner's Smart Buy notes: it's handed the
  // purchases actually landed here (not the plan's own precomputed count/total, which may run
  // ahead of what `timeLimit` allows) — including `elapsedSeconds`, the real time this sweep's own
  // purchases actually took (`helpers.getElapsedSeconds()` at the moment the note is built, NOT

  // regardless of what was actually bought; see `saleAwareStats70`'s identical fix in
  // useResearchViews.ts for the same bug in the manual planner's equivalent stat) — and, if it

 * For a given `saleCount`, the Tier 13 attempt (when one is made at all) always runs BEFORE the
 * non-Tier-13 one, and the non-Tier-13 variant is skipped entirely whenever that attempt succeeds:
 * a successful Tier 13 unlock strictly dominates not unlocking it (same total build-phase time
 * spent either way, strictly more research afterward), so the non-Tier-13 sibling can never win the
 * caller's comparison and isn't worth the cost of computing (here, and — more importantly — of the
 * caller's own full ascension completion downstream). The non-Tier-13 variant is still computed
 * whenever Tier 13 wasn't attempted at all for this `saleCount` (already unlocked before C3 started,
 * or pruned via `tier13KnownImpossible`) or was attempted and failed — that's the only case it can
 * legitimately win. Returned in ascending `saleCount` order regardless of the internal descending
 * walk, so callers see a stable, predictable order.
