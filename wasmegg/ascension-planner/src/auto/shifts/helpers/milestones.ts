 *
 * Two distinct reasons drive the one-level-at-a-time structure, both load-bearing:
 *
 * - Reachability: `runResearchMilestoneIfWorthwhile` noops its ENTIRE chain if it can't fully reach
 *   its target level — aiming one call straight at max risks a single unreachable (or merely
 *   not-worth-it) level near the top silently discarding purchases on every cheaper level below it.
 *   Targeting one level up at a time means that only stops the loop from there.
 * - Time budget: `maxOptimizedSeconds` is capped at the remaining budget (not leaved `Infinity`),
 *   so a level whose OWN chain (target level plus whatever earnings research speeds up reaching it)
 *   can't fully finish within what's left gets skipped entirely, rather than partially executed.
 *   `optimizedSeconds` is the chain's own full real-time cost to reach the target level (see
 *   `computeMilestoneSummaryCore`); without this cap, a level whose chain eventually completes but
 *   takes far longer than what's left (e.g. a graviton coupling level needing weeks against a
 *   couple hours of remaining shift) still passed the worthwhile gate, then `executeChain` bought as
 *   much of that chain — earnings-research detours included — as fit in the time limit before giving
 *   up on the target itself, stranding real gems and shift time spent chasing a level that was never
 *   going to land. Capping here means a level whose chain can't finish in time buys NOTHING toward it
 *   at all: finish the chain, or don't start it.
 *
 * Each level's chain still buys whatever earnings research speeds up reaching THAT level along the
 * way — no separate earnings-buying pass needed.
