# Egg, Inc Helper Tools by @mk2, forked by @CarpetSage

If you're trying to learn to develop against the private Egg, Inc. API, look into [`protobuf/ei.proto`](protobuf/ei.proto) and [`lib/api`](lib/api) first.

If you want to contribute reach please reach out to me on discord first (@carpetsage). I am open to pull requests

If you want to build this yourself I suggest looking at the various Makefiles and the github build yamls in .github/workflows
