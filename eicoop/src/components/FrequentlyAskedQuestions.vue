          is confirmed production (already checked-in); the solid lighter green bar
          <span
            class="inline-block h-4 w-4 bg-green-350 border border-gray-300 relative top-0.5"

          is currently estimated production taking into account how long each member has been offline
          (i.e., it would be the confirmed value if everyone checked-in now); the striped bar
          <span
            class="inline-block h-4 w-4 ProgressBar--striped border border-gray-300 relative top-0.5"
          ></span>
          is projected total production before contract expiration. You can hover over or click on
          the progress bar to reveal more details in a tooltip. In general, many UI elements can be
          hovered over or clicked on to reveal more information. If you don't see a lighter green bar you may need to
          disable your Dark Reader or other dark mode browser extension. This site has a dark mode already.

          Is population growth taken into account in projections?
        </dt>
        <dd class="mt-1 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
          Unfortunately no. For coops, the game's API simply does not expose enough information to
          make it possible. For non-coops, it is possible to predict population growth if the game
          is kept offline, but potential active play (which disturbs internal hatchery calm) and the
          fact that the game syncs at unpredictable moments makes projection unreliable, and
          considerable over-projection possible in some common scenarios. Therefore, the feature is
          not implemented for now out of an abundance of caution. With enough user interest, this
          feature can be reconsidered.
